jigsaw puzzle solver

color_histogram is the actual solver. You need to write the name of the reference image file along with a puzzle piece image file.
It'll show you the reference image with the most likely squares highlighted

Depending on the puzzle, you need to actually input how you need to split it (how many pieces in a row, and in a column)

## Online Jigsaw Puzzle Solver
Source of image: ???

You need to write the name of the reference image file along with a puzzle piece image file in main.py.
It shows you the reference image with the most likely squares highlighted

Depending on the puzzle, you may need to actually input how you need to split it (how many pieces in a row, and in a column).

## Todo:
-find source of camel_stars image and add it to the readme as well as its folder file
-use command line to run the program (argparse)
    have the if name == "__main__" with your arguments at the end of the file
